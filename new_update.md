### Updates needed

# In the navigation bar / Hamburger menu on mobile we need :
1. Info icon that opens a modal with the info from the file info_update.pdf (You can find it in the main folder). It must be displayed in both Italian and Spanish as the rest of the website controlled by the language buttons.
2. a Whatsapp icon that opens whatsapp chat with the number +34697798991

# The testimonials section is changing a little bit. We need left and right arrows to navigate through the testimonials. Both on Desktop and Mobile. They don't need to be animated by sliding automatically, it will be controlled by the arrows.
# Also, the Testimonials must be displayed properly with or without image - video - or just text. All testimonial cards have the same size no matter the content.
