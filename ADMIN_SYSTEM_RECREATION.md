# Free Voice Academy - Admin System Recreation

## Summary

I have completely recreated the admin system from scratch as requested. The old admin files were deleted and replaced with a comprehensive new system that allows full management of all website content.

## What was created:

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure
- **workshops** - Manages workshop information (title, description, price, date, location, etc.) in both Italian and Spanish
- **testimonials** - Stores customer testimonials with video/image support and approval system  
- **coaches** - Team member profiles with specialties and bios in both languages
- **site_content** - General website content (hero text, contact info, footer text)
- **admin_users** - Admin authentication
- **admin_sessions** - Session management

### üîß Admin Panel Features

#### Complete CRUD Operations for:
1. **Workshops Management**
   - Add/edit/delete workshops
   - Set pricing, dates, locations, instructors
   - Mark as popular or active/inactive
   - Bilingual content (Italian/Spanish)

2. **Testimonials Management** 
   - Add customer testimonials
   - Upload video/image content
   - Approve/reject testimonials
   - Set display order
   - Bilingual content support

3. **Coaches Management**
   - Add team member profiles
   - Upload profile images
   - Set specialties and bio information
   - Control display order
   - Bilingual titles and descriptions

4. **Content Management**
   - Edit hero section text
   - Update contact information
   - Modify footer content
   - All bilingual content

### üåê API Endpoints

#### Admin Routes (Authenticated):

### üîê Admin Access

**Admin Login Credentials:**
- URL: `/admin`
- Email: `xk7m9p@freevoice.es`
- Password: `K9mR7nQ2vX8pL5wY`

### üé® New Admin Dashboard Features

1. **Overview Dashboard** - Statistics and quick actions
2. **Workshop Management** - Full workshop lifecycle
3. **Testimonials** - Customer feedback management with video support
4. **Coaches** - Team member management
5. **Content Editor** - Website content management

### üîÑ Frontend Integration

The admin system automatically populates:
- Coaches section (loads from database with static fallback)
- Testimonials section (loads from database with static fallback)  
- Pricing/workshop information (loads from database)
- All content is bilingual (Italian/Spanish)

### ‚úÖ Key Improvements

1. **Database-Driven**: All content now stored in database instead of hardcoded
2. **Bilingual Support**: Proper separation of Italian and Spanish content
3. **Media Management**: Video and image upload support for testimonials
4. **Approval System**: Testimonials can be approved/rejected
5. **Display Control**: Order management for all content types
6. **Security**: Proper authentication and session management
7. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly admin interface

## Next Steps

1. Login to the admin panel at `/admin` using the credentials above
2. Add, edit, or delete workshops, testimonials, and coaches as needed
3. The website will automatically update with your changes
4. Consider changing the admin password after first login

The system is fully functional and ready for content management!
